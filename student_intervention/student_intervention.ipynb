    "- This model is widely applied in Recommender Systems. Netflix is leveraging it to recommend new content to its customers. (https://www.quora.com/What-are-industry-applications-of-the-K-nearest-neighbor-algorithm) As long as people have watched a few movies that are the same and rated them (implicitly or explicitly), Netflix is able to leverage that feedback and suggest new movies based on other people's ratings and similarities between users' preferences.\n",
    "- Strengths: \n",
    "    - robust to noisy data (it's instance based, only cares about the neighbours) \n",
    "    - simple to implement and easy to explain\n",
    "- Weaknesses: \n",
    "    - classifying a new example/executing queries is quite expensive, depending on the number of neighbours and the complexity of the similarity function (since no training is happening upfront)\n",
    "    - KNN is very affceted by the curse of dimensionality: exponentially more data is needed for every extra feature introduced\n",
    "    - reseracher needs to make a lot of decisions that can influence the output of the algorithm (choice of similarity/distance metric, the number of neighbors to consider, voting rules and breaking ties)\n",
    "- KNN is a good candidate for solving the problem at hand because it is a classification algorithm and finding students **similar** to those who failed in the past seems like a reasonable thing to do (and KNN is based on the notion similarity). \n",

Naive Bayes is able to predict how probable a certain combination of words is in a real email, and if it is below a certian arbitrary threshold, the email is considered to be spam.\n",
    "- Strengths:\n",
    "    - elegant, easy to implement, efficient, empirically successful\n",
    "    - inference is cheap (growing leanearly with the number of attributed --> handles a large number of features well)\n",
    "    - the model has few parameters that can be easily estimated with labeled data (counting and dividing by total count)\n",
    "    - handles missing attributes well\n",

    "    - in natural language processing, doesn't deal well with phrases that consist of multiple words that take a different meaning than each word in the phrase (like hockey team \"Ottawa Senators\")\n",
    "    - need to pay attention to new values of attributes that have not been yet seen in the dataset, because estimated with the data probability of that value will be 0, hence the product will be 0 as well --> need to apply smoothing of probabilities\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

It does have a troubling trend of producing worse F1 scores on test data with the increase of the training set size.

In the picture below, extra dimention is the the length to the center of the circle, so all triangles have a smaller length measure than all the circles. Hence, triangles will all be below a certain length and circles will all be above it. This means that somewhere around there a linear boundary can be drawn.\n",
